# ProStruct
ProStruct is a protein structure analysis tool with the end goal of becoming a solution for protein structure analysis with high performance computing. Got a long way to go!

This is a C++ library, because it's fast and becoming quite accessible. Ultimately I will write CUDA code to cover the heavy lifting.

There are no concrete plans at the moment to what it will be able to do, it will primarily depend on my needs during my PhD and integration with [AbPyTools-Qt](https://github.com/gf712/AbPyTools-Qt/).

It will initially focus mainly on finding local clusters of residues.
